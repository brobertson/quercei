= Description

This plugin is a super lightweight tool used to manage all your fixtures, whether it is exporting or importing them.

So if you want to export all your data from your production server into your development environment, this will simplify the process without having to load up your database manager. 

Similarly, if you want to import a selected set of Models, you can do that using the appropriate tasks.
